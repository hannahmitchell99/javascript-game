# Superhero Smackdown! ðŸ’¥
A Javascript game that allows the user to select and fight a fellow superhero !

---
## How does it work? ðŸŽ®

This game allows the user to choose one of six superheros. Of the leftovers, the opponent is randomly selected and continues to play against the player by randomly selecting a move when the player selects a move!

### These moves could be one of the following:

- A signature move
- A special ability

### This continues until the first hero's health is depleted. ðŸ˜ª

---
### Let's see it in action!
