# Superhero Smackdown! 💥
A Javascript game that allows the user to select and fight a fellow superhero !

---
## How does it work? 🎮

This game allows the user to choose one of six superheros. Of the leftovers, the opponent is randomly selected and continues to play against the player by randomly selecting a move when the player selects a move!

### These moves could be one of the following:

- A signature move
- A special ability (which is more powerful)

**But there's a catch....**

Because the player may over-use the special ability function, using special ability may result in less damage to the opponent than intended. Because the opponent may have more of an even approach to moves, their use of special ability packs even more of a punch! 💥

### This continues until the first hero's health is depleted. 😪

## Let's see it in action!

## The Planning Process & Pseudocode 💻

The planning process began on paper - writing out *how I wanted it to look, and function. And ideally, what I'd add on*.

### This was my initial plan and my steps to guide me throughout ✏️
