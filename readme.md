# Superhero Smackdown! 💥
A Javascript game that allows the user to select and fight a fellow superhero !

---
## How does it work? 🎮

This game allows the user to choose one of six superheros. Of the leftovers, the opponent is randomly selected and continues to play against the player by randomly selecting a move when the player selects a move!

### These moves could be one of the following:

- A signature move
- A special ability

### This continues until the first hero's health is depleted. 😪

---
## Let's see it in action!

## The Planning Process & Pseudocode 💻

The planning process began on paper - writing out *how I wanted it to look, and function. And ideally, what I'd add on*.

### This was my initial plan and my steps to guide me throughout ✏️
